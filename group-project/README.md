**Description**: Our app, ‘Daily Outlook’ is an app created using the React library. The purpose of the app is to allow users to view what time the sun will rise and set depending on their location, plus the option to view an inspirational quote and the current phase of the moon. The main goal of this app is to give users a space to access information with ease. For a variety of reasons, there are plenty of people that regularly need to know what time the sun will come up/go down, and what the current moon phase is. In addition, many people find it beneficial to start their day with a motivational quote. On a daily basis, our app gives users a quick, convenient, and visually appealing  way to access each of those things.

**Minimum, Need to Have Features**: The need-to-have features exist on the Home page and the Daily Advice page. On our home page, a user can type in their city and choose between three button options (Sunrise, Sunset and Moon Phase), and when they press the button, the information they’re seeking will display. On the Daily Advice page, quality advice in the form of a motivational quote (and the author who wrote the quote) will display on the page just by clicking a button.

**Post MVP**: Post MVP, we'd potentially like to implement a Weather API so that users will be able to use our App to check the weather on a daily basis in addition to the sunrise, sunset and moon phase.

**Built With**: Built using JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and the React library.
